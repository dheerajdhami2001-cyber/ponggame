Description

This is a two-player Pong game where each player controls a paddle to hit a ball back and forth. The objective is to score points by making the ball pass the opponent's paddle. The first player to miss the ball concedes a point to the other.

Features

Two-Player Gameplay: Compete against a friend on the same keyboard.

Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the score for each player, displayed at the top of the screen.

Increasing Difficulty: The ball's speed increases slightly each time it is hit by a paddle, making the game more challenging over time.

Simple Controls: Easy-to-learn controls for intuitive gameplay.
