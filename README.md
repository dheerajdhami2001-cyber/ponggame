# Pong Game in Python

A classic implementation of the arcade game Pong, built with Python's Turtle module. This project was created as part of my learning journey through Dr. Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code" bootcamp.

## About The Project

This project demonstrates the principles of object-oriented programming and event handling in Python. It features two paddles controlled by the players, a ball that bounces off the walls and paddles, and a scoring system to keep track of the winner.
